IntelliJ-PPImport Plugin
========================

This plugin was initially written to import xml-content files into the polopoly CMS.
I can imagine though, that there are others CMS/apps which also provide in an import servlet and for which this plugin can be reused.

Key features:

    - import a single file or import multiple file selections
    - import not only from the editor, but also from project tool window
    - multiple files can be imported in bulk as a jar (specific Polopoly functionality)
    - specify multiple targets (e.g. local, dev, staging and production) directly accessible from the context menu
    - specify file extensions to import
    - protect against accidental imports by asking for a confirmation (per target configurable)

If you see other opportunities/features let me know or contribute!

I'll gladly answer your questions asap ;)
